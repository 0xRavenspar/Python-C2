Python C2 Framework (Educational Purpose Only)

Overview
This is a Python-based Command-and-Control (C2) framework developed for educational purposes to demonstrate the concepts of C2 communication and remote task execution in cybersecurity. It is designed to help students, researchers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts learn how attackers manage compromised systems and how defenders can detect and mitigate such threats.
